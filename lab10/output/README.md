## Comparison between lab1 and lab10

In Lab1, I was exploring the problem of code maintainability. I looked at what was common between 
the 3 gumball machines and what was different. In Lab1 we needed to modify code for different cost, etc.

In Lab2, I am using a feature model. The configuration is handled separately in a config file. This file is called device.config. When I want a different model, I can change the configuration. Also, the code is less with feature model.

So lab10 is easier to maintain than lab1.
