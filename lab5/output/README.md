On 3/9/2019 my husband and I went to Five Guys.

I sketched out the flow of activities as follows:

1) I placed the order with the cashier
2) The cashier completed the order
3) The cashier gave me a receipt
4) She then called out "3 patties"
5) The Bun Guy then prepared the buns
6) The Bun Guy passed the order details to Toppings Guy
7) The Toppings Guy (could also be called Assembly Guy) then
    -   Received the order details including the prepared bun on foil
    -   Added toppings
    -   She then waited till the burger was grilled
    -   When burger was grilled she assembled the burger
    -   When the frys were done, she packed the complete order in a bag
    -   She then notified us that #14 was done
8) We received our yummy food and consumed it there
