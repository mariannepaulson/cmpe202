I used the strategy pattern to encapsulate the difference between printing out
a receipt vs a package slip.

I used the composite pattern to encapsulate what varies on an order.
For example, a burger can have many kinds of different toppings.
Therefore, it is wise to keep a composite with an array that can hold
all the "children" that varies dynamically when creating an order.
