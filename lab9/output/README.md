## Lab 9 Marianne Paulson

For the implementation of patterns, the following interfaces and classes were created

Subject         -   Interface
Observer        -   Interface

ConcreteSubject
ConcreteObject

Pessimist
Optimist
TheEconomy

For the functional implementation, I do not create Pessimist and Optimist. The reason is that 
the lambda expression, that represents the behavior to be executed for the pessimist and optimist,
can be passed directly to the subject.

In the pattern implementation, it is the update method in pessimist and optimist that 
represents the behavior to be executed.

The code with Lambda expressions is more precise with less classes.
