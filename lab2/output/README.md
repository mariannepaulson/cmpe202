**********************************
part 1 - UML Class Diagram
**********************************

All Classes and Interfaces in the program are included as Classifiers.

Made Attributes Compartment empty by unclicking Attribute Compartment under Initial Visibility.

For all Classes, only Public Methods (including Constructors) show.

I chose to show Methods Implemented from Interfaces.

Method Signatures are shown on Interfaces.

I chose to display Abstract methods in "italics".

Only show Dependency Relationships that are Dependent on Interfaces

Multiplicities are shown.


*********************************
part 2 - UML Sequence Diagram
*********************************

Drew all Participants (Objects) with their actual Class Types.

Included Activation Bars.

Included parameters for all messages from caller participants to callees.

I chose to include return message lines and print output to console from Diagram.

I did not include constructor calls. I assumed all participants have been
instantiated.


Thank you!
